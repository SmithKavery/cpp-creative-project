# cpp-creative-project — Student Records Manager

## What it is
A simple C++ console program to add, list, search, save, and load student records with grades. Demonstrates:
- user-defined functions (multiple, including overloaded `findStudent`)
- arrays & strings (`std::array` and `std::string`)
- control structures (loops, switch)
- file handling (save/load text file)
- input validation / error handling
- modular code with header and implementation files
- bonus: recursion used to sum grades for GPA calculation
